## UIPickerView for inputting custom data model

In RaceX, there's all these custom PickerView + Toolbar, each which have to have a datasource and delegate.
Ideally, my data models should confirm to a "Pickable" protocol:
- Responds to number of elements in total
- Gives a list of all possible values
- When user makes a selection, the DataPickerView returns the correct data model item.

For example... DataPicker<BloodType> which asks the BloodType data model for all possible values, and returns a chosenBloodType


## Custom Views...
1. Transparent navigation bar?

## View Controller extension
IBAction for dismissing a VC
